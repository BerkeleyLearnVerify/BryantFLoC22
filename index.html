                  of Satisfiability Testing (SAT)
                  conference on August 5, 2022 in Haifa, Israel. This page provides the

              <div>
                <p>Randal E. Bryant is the Founders University Professor of Computer Science Emeritus at
                  Carnegie Mellon University. He has been on the faculty at Carnegie Mellon since
                  1984. He also holds a courtesy appointment in
                  the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department. He served as Dean of the School
                  of Computer Science from 2004 to 2014.</p>
                <p>Dr. Bryant's research focuses on methods for formally verifying digital hardware, and
                  more recently some forms of software. He is well known for the development of the
                  ordered binary decision diagram (OBDD) data structure, used not just for formal
                  hardware and software verification, but also digital circuit testing and synthesis,
                  AI planning, and combinatorial optimization. In addition, he has developed several
                  techniques to verify circuits by symbolic simulation, with levels of abstraction
                  ranging from transistors to models based on first-order logic.</p>
                <p>Dr. Bryant has received widespread recognition for his work. He is a fellow of the
                  IEEE and the ACM, as well as a member of the National Academy of Engineering and the
                  American Academy of Arts and Science. His awards include the 1997 ACM Kanellakis
                  Theory and Practice Award (shared with Edmund M. Clarke, Ken McMillan, and Allen
                  Emerson) for contributing to the development of symbolic model checking, as well as
                  the 1989 IEEE W.R.G. Baker Prize for the best paper appearing in any IEEE
                  publication during the preceding year. He received the 2010 ACM/IEEE A. Richard
                  Newton Technical Award in Electronic Design Automation, the 2009 EDAC/IEEE Phil
                  Kaufman Award, and the 2007 IEEE Emmanuel R. Piore Award, reflecting the impact his
                  work has had on tools used by the semiconductor industry for verifying their designs
                  prior to manufacture.</p>
                <p>Dr. Bryant teaches courses in computer systems and parallel computing.
                  Along with David R. O'Hallaron, he developed a novel approach to
                  teaching about the hardware, networking, and system software that
                  comprise a system from the perspective of an advanced programmer,
                  rather than from those of the system designers. Their textbook
                  ``Computer Systems: A Programmer's Perspective,'' now in its third
                  edition, is in use at over 375 institutions worldwide, with
                  translations into five languages.</p>
                <p>Dr. Bryant spent the 1989-1990 academic year as a Visiting Research
                  Fellow at Fujitsu Laboratories in Kawasaki, Japan. He spent the
                  2014-2015 academic year as Assistant Director for Information
                  Technology Research and Development at the White House Office of
                  Science and Technology Policy (OSTP). There he worked on the National
                  Strategic Computing Initiative, issued as Executive Order 13702 in
                  July, 2015.</p>
                <p>Dr. Bryant received his B.S. in Applied Mathematics from the
                  University of Michigan in 1973, and his PhD in computer science from
                  MIT in 1981. He was an assistant professor at Caltech from 1981 to
                  1984.
