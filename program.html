              <p>I will describe how decision diagrams can form the basis of a generic branch-and-bound method for discrete optimization.  Using a state-based input model (e.g., a dynamic program), the method employs relaxed and restricted BDDs to provide optimization bounds.  I will compare this approach to classical optimization methods such as integer programming and constraint programming.</p>

              <summary>Our Tools Should Generate Checkable Proofs</summary>
              <p>For over four decades, I have helped develop tools that enable designers to create correct hardware and software systems. Some of these tools even claimed to provide formal guarantees of correctness. But they had a fundamental flawâ€”an error in an underlying algorithm or its implementation could cause the tool to produce an incorrect result. The prospects for developing efficient and scalable tools that are themselves formally verified seem unlikely. On the other hand, having tools produce checkable proofs of correctness yields nearly the same benefit. Even if the tool is buggy, each of its run can be formally verified. The SAT community instituted a requirement that solvers (at least those in the main track of the SAT competition) generate checkable proofs of unsatisfiability. This requirement has had a transformative effect on the quality of the solvers, the productivity of the developers, and the certainty of the competition results. We can learn from their experience in instituting this practice for other areas of automated reasoning.</p>
